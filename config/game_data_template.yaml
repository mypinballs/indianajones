# This file is a template for all of the statistical data to be kept for the game.# The game code will load this file along with a game_data.yaml file.  
# Any items not present in the game_data.yaml file will default to the 
# value specified here.  When game ends or when defaults are restored, 
# game_data will be written and will then contain every item here.
