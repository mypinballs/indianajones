# Indiana Jones Pinball V2 by myPinballs

##Aim
To create new pinball software for Williams Indiana Jones : The Pinball Adventure using the original rules, sounds, graphics as a basis and then adding to them. New features such as a ball start skillshot, deeper multiball jackpots, modes for the 4th film are planned, as well as improving some of the original modes and rule logic.

##Author
[mypinballs](http://www.mypinballs.co.uk) is Jim Askey, a Java J2EE software programmer and long term pinball addict/restorer. The opportunity to write new software using the excellent p-roc hardware and pyprocgame development framework for his favourite all time titles proved too much not to have a go :)
