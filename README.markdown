## Indiana Jones V2

#Aim
To create new pinball software for Williams Indiana Jones : The Pinball Adventure using the original rules, sounds, graphics as a basis and then adding to them. New features such as a ball start skillshot, deeper multiball jackpots, modes for the 4th film are planned, as well as improving some of the original modes and rule logic.

The opportunity to write new software using the excellent p-roc hardware and pyprocgame development framework for his favourite all time titles proved too much not to have a go :)
